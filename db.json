    "name":"Yellow Butter Cake",
    "description":"Many a kid's birthday party is celebrated with a sheet-cake version of this dessert that's topped with billows of chocolate frosting and rainbow sprinkles. Yellow butter cakes often involve creaming the butter and sugar together (in modern times, this is done with an electric mixer) then adding the dry and wet ingredients, but there are also “dump” versions where all of the ingredients are thrown into a bowl and simply mixed together.",

    "name":"Pound Cake",
    "description":"Named because it's made with a pound of each of the main ingredients (flour, butter, and sugar), this cake doesn’t rise much while baking, and the texture is very dense. Our version boasts matcha and cocoa powder, but classic recipes have nothing but vanilla extract to flavor it. Bake up one of these beauties in a loaf or Bundt pan",

    "name":"Red Velvet Cake",
    "description":"This is a true favorite, especially in the south. Made with either butter or oil, red velvet cake's color classically comes from the reaction of buttermilk and cocoa powder.

    "name":"Devil’s Food Cake",

    "name":"Sponge Cak",
    "description":"This is a foam-style cake that has no artificial leaveners (baking powder or baking soda). It gets its volume solely from whipped eggs —either whole eggs or simply whites. This cake takes well to being soaked in a flavored syrup (try soaking with a lemon syrup and serve with a dollop of lemon curd), layered with whipped cream and smashed berries, or if baked up thin, rolled in the Christmas classic, Buche de Noel.",
